---
Warning This product is in active development/beta. Iâ€™ll try to fix things as I go, but updates arenâ€™t promised on any specific schedule. I am releasing this now because it works for me and maybe for you. All known glitches are shown in the video (tested on Unity 2021 and MVN 2024.2)  ONLY BUY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THIS.

ðŸ‘‰ **Only purchase if you understand this**:

## What Does This Plugin Do?

It streams data from Xsens MVN to Unity3D

## Simply put:





This app allows you to pipe Xsens MVN data into Unity.



Then you can record, export an FBX, or go full-on VTuber with live streaming.

## What Itâ€™s NOT:





An exploit for MVN. (Iâ€™m not trying to get sued) Youâ€™re still on the free plan, so youâ€™ll still have whatever limitations that entails.



A native recorder that exports FBXs directly from MVN. (for now)


## ðŸ“Œ Legal Note  

This project **does NOT modify or crack Xsens MVN software**. It is a standalone plugin that interacts with **Ogre3D**, an open-source rendering engine.
